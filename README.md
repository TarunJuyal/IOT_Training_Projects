Small projects I did during my summer training in IOT

Includes small projects like Traffic Light Sytem using LEDs,Temperature and Humidity Sensor connected via Blynk app etc.

## Car Parking Management with Empty Slots Detection

Traffic congestions caused by vehicles is an alarming problem at global scale and it has been growing exponentially. This Project gives information of empty parking slots on our phones. We use NodeMCU with ESP8266 . It is connected with IR Sensors that give the real time occupancy of parking slot and send that information to Blynk App.
Blynk App creates widgets so as to control the Node MCU using our smartphones easily. We create 4 LEDs to show availability in Blynk and paste the authorization code in the Arduino IDE which has a code that would be uploaded into the Node MCU.
